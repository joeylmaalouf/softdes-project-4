SoftDes Meeting Checkin
Joey Maalouf
Daniel Bishop

Notes:
-focus on quality over quantity
-consider difference between game vs demo
	(e.g. actually having multiple levels vs. showing the capability for multiple levels)
-maybe keep multiple games if they interact differently?

For Next Time:
-flesh out current ideas
-brainstorm more input ideas
-maybe have one or two games with keyboard input, one with camera input, etc.
