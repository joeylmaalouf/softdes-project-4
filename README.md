=================

A collaboration to test interactive programming via PyGame.

##Directory Structure:

* The `/assets/` folder contains images used in the programs.
* The `/code/` folder contains the Python files that make up the programs.
* The `/docs/` folder contains miscellaneous documentation.
* The `/media/` folder contains screenshots of the working games.
* The `/saves/` folder contains savestates for the Game of Life.

`/code/main.py` is the file to execute in order to start at the main menu. From this menu, you can access multiple different games.

The options are:
* Dot Shooter (`/code/dot.py`)
* Game of Life (`/code/gol.py`)
* Super Meat Boy (`/code/smb.py`)

Code exists for other, incomplete games:
* Floating Point (`/code/fp.py`)
* SkyRoads (`/code/sr.py`)

But these files can be safely ignored.
